She marched out of the door and down to the chicken coop, where she saw a large rock and a loose egg lying on the floor. As she approached, the chickens fled, clucking loudly. When Chloe threw the egg at the rock, it cracked. Chloe\u2019s parents stormed out of the house after her. When they found the mess she had made, they told her she would have to wash the dishes every night that week too.",

She had decided to bring a couple of summer dresses to wear while she was there, a shirt and a pair of jeans for the flight home, and a book to read on the beach. She was going to meet her friend, Laura, at the hotel when she arrived. Charlotte packed her book in the same suitcase as her shirt. When she took it out, it was creased. She left her bag in her hotel room and went out for a walk along the beach. The late evening sun cast a gorgeous light on the white stone of the houses.",

She hadn\u2019t had time to eat lunch, and she was starting to get hungry. Alice stuffed her wallet in her pocket with a banana. When she took it out, it was squashed. She slumped into a chair in the waiting room, feeling annoyed. Fortunately, she was only a few minutes late for her appointment, and the previous customer was just getting ready to pay.",
