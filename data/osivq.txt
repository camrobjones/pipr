I was very good in 3D geometry as a student
I have difficulty expressing myself in writing
If I were asked to choose between engineering professions and visual arts, I would prefer engineering
My verbal abilities would make a career in language arts relatively easy for me
Architecture interests me more than painting
My images are very colourful and bright
I prefer schematic diagrams and sketches when reading a textbook instead of colourful and pictorial illustrations
I tell jokes and stories better than most people
Essay writing is difficult for me and I do not enjoy doing it at all
My images are more like schematic representations of things and events rather than like detailed pictures
When reading fiction, I usually form a clear and detailed mental picture of a scene or room that has been described
If I were asked to choose among engineering professions, or visual arts, I would choose visual arts 
I have a photographic memory
I can easily imagine and mentally rotate three-dimensional geometric figures
I enjoy pictures with bright colours and unusual shapes like the ones in modern art
My verbal skills are excellent
When thinking about an abstract concept (or building), I imagine an abstract schematic building in my mind or its blueprint rather than a specific concrete building
When entering a familiar store to get a specific item, I can easily picture the exact location of the target item, the shelf it stands on, how it is arranged and the surrounding articles
Putting together furniture kits (e.g. a TV stand or a chair) is much easier for me when I have detailed verbal instructions than when I only have a diagram or picture
My images are very vivid and photographic
When explaining something, I would rather give verbal explanations than make drawings or sketches 
If someone were to give me two-digit numbers to add (e.g. 43 and 32) I would simply do the adding without visualizing the numbers
My mental images of different objects very much resemble the size, shape and colour of actual objects that I have seen
I usually do not try to visualize or sketch diagrams when reading a textbook
I normally do not experience many spontaneous vivid images; I use my mental imagery mostly when attempting to solve some problems like the ones in mathematics
When I imagine the face of a friend, I have a perfectly clear and bright image
I have excellent abilities in technical graphics
When remembering a scene, I use verbal descriptions rather than mental pictures
I can easily remember a great deal of visual details that someone else might never notice. For example, I would just automatically take some things in, like what colour is a shirt someone wears or what colour are his/her shoes
I can easily sketch a blueprint for a building I am familiar with
In school, I had no problems with geometry
I am good in playing spatial games involving constructing from blocks and paper (e.g. Lego, Tetris, Origami)
Sometimes my images are so vivid and persistent that it is difficult to ignore them
I can close my eyes and easily picture a scene that I have experienced
I have better than average fluency in using words
I would rather have a verbal description of an object or person than a picture
I am always aware of sentence structure
My images are more schematic than colourful and pictorial
I enjoy being able to rephrase my thoughts in many ways for variety’s sake in both writing and speaking
I remember everything visually. I can recount what people wore to a dinner and I can talk about the way they sat and the way they looked probably in more detail than I could discuss what they said
I sometimes have a problem expressing exactly what I want to say
I find it difficult to imagine how a three-dimensional geometric figure would exactly look like when rotated
My visual images are in my head all the time. They are just right there
My graphic abilities would make a career in architecture relatively easy for me
When I hear a radio announcer or a DJ I’ve never actually seen, I usually find myself picturing what he or she might look like
